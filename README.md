# isgood-api

The API layer between the isgood AI/brain platform, and the apps and services that connect to it.

Preferences:  
\- openAPI spec, with json focus, easy to maintain and contribute  
\- python/JS code base preferred  
\- function well with our RDS postgresDBs Â (ai platform and webapp/s)  
\- testable and able to be collaborated on via git repo  
\- easy to connect, but auth is very secure  
\- high-throughput, high-volume
